          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks by State</h2>
          <h4>An analysis of obesity and smoking habits</h4>
          <hr>
          <p>Based on the dataset, there is a strong positive correlation (0.740173) between obesity and smoking. The scatter chart supports this correlation as both the % obesity and % smoking increase at a fairly linear rate.</p>

          <p>Of the top five states in smoking (WV, KY, AR, TN, LA) and the top five states in obesity (AR, WV, MS, LA, AL), three states overlap both lists (AR, WV, LA) with all three having top ranked rates of 35% obesity and 24-26% smoking. West Virginia (WV) leads in both obesity and smoking.</p>

          <p>The analysis of additional factors would be interesting to assess the relationship of smoking to obesity. These factors may include (but are not limited to): availability of recreation or open spaces, states where tobacco* is grown, and access to quality (non-processed) food sources.
          </br>*WV, KY, TN are included the top tobacco growing states. Source: http://www.virginiaplaces.org/agriculture/tobacco.html (last download Apr 3, 2021)
